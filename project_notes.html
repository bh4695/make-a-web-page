        The World Wide Web

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with
          each other. HTML documents make up the visual part of
          the world wide web.
        </p>
        <p>
          A person receives these HTML documents from the web 
          via <em>HTTP</em> request sent to and from a <em>web
          browser</em>. Here is a link to a <a href= "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496"> video </a> for further explination.

        HTML

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup
          Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
          content on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents contain <em>text
          content</em> which describes "what you see" and
          <em>markup</em> which describes
          "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This

        Tags and Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing 
          HTML, we tell browsers the type of each <b><em>element</em></b>
          by using HTML <b><em>tags</em></b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Tags:</b> "b" tag (<b>bold</b>) or "em" tag (
          <em>italics or emphais</em>). Tags are made up of an
          open tag and a closed tag with some sort of contents 
          between them. The contents that falls between the open
          and close tags is what the tags are being applied to.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Attributes:</b> "a" (<b>anchor</b>) attribute is for
          creating links. This attribute is made up of the attribute
          name (<em>href</em>), value (<em>web address 
          "www.google.com"</em>), and discripter word that will be 
          highlighted indicating a link is present.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
         <b>Image:</b> "img" (<b>image</b>) tags are <em>VOID</em>
          tags, which means they don't have content. They are made
          up of <em>src</em> (source or location of saved image) 
          and <em>alt</em> (alternate text to be displayed when 
          fails to load.

        Communicating with Computers
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Communication with computers is very difficult due to
          the fact that they interpret instructions literally. 
          So the process of communication is very unforgiving
          due to a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge 
          problems in a program as well as making the debugging
          process difficult.

        Inline vs Block Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML elements are either <b>inline</b>
          or <b>block</b>. Block elements form
          an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Container Elements:</b> are elements that contain 
          nested text or content of other elements. Examples of
          container elements are <b><em> span</em></b> which is 
          an inline element and <b><em>dib</em></b> which is a 
          block element.

        Developer Tools (in the Browser)
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Developer Tools allows you inspect or see the HTML
          elements in a "tree like" structure. This tool also
          helps the programmer visualize the content as either 
          <em>block</em> or <em>inline</em>.

        The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
          elements can have other elements inside of them. This is 
          also refered to as <em>Nested</em> elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
          of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
          inside of boxes, and so on.

        The relationship between indented HTML and boxes
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When you read an HTML document as
          <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
          changing indentations going up and down the left side
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

        <p>
          <em>HTML</em> is the structure (framework) of a webpage.
          <br><em>CSS</em> is the style of a webpage, how it looks.
          <br><em>Java Script</em> is the interactive componets of
          a website.
          <br><br>
          <em>DOM:</em> Document object Model is the tree like 
          structure of an HTML document.
        </p>
        <p>
          All elements of an HTML document are rectanglar in shape. So in other words an HTML document is made up of a seris of smaller boxes on top of larger or a large box.

      <div class="concept-title">
        Avoiding Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Errors:</b> repetition in programming is the act of writing the same
          code over and over or copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements many times. This can and in most cases does lead to errors being introduced into your code when a change is made. If the change is
          is not made everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consistency:</b> by using <b><em>CSS</em></b> or <b><em>STYLE</em></b> tags it introduces consistency and avoid repetition of code. This is accomplished by assigning <em>div</em> the same <em>class</em> and specifying the style for each class in one place. This allows the 
          programmer to make changes to the style very eaisly and quickly.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-2">
      <div class="concept-title">
        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for <b><em>C</em></b>ascading <b><em>S</em></b>tyle 
          <b><em>S</em></b>heets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <b>class</b> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Inheritance:</b> (ancestor-decendant relationship) is the
          mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a 
          specified element, but also its decendents. This means that
          a nested or child element inherits any properties from the 
          main or parent element unless that property or rule is
          overridden by property or rule in that specific element.

          <p>
            <b>Code, Test, Refine</b> refers to the process or 
            steps that programmers take when developing a web
            page. The 5 main steps are as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>1.</b> Look for natural boxes <br>
            <b>2.</b> Look for repeated styles and semantiz elements<br>
            <b>3.</b> Write your HTML<br>
            <b>4.</b> Apply styles (move <b>BIGGEST</b> to <em> smallest</em>)<br>
            <b>5.</b> Test and Fix
